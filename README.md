# GGJ-2018

A Co-Op escape game. You and your playmate find each other in a closed room, without having any idea why you are there. Your goal? Get out of each room by solving the riddles that dot them. However, you will not be able to do it alone: you will need your partner to solve the puzzles you find in your respective rooms. The secret of your success? The **transmission** of information, that you will glean in all the rooms that you will visit.

This game was made with [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) during the [Global Game Jam 2018](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games) by the [Tarkiflettes](https://github.com/Tarkiflettes) team.
